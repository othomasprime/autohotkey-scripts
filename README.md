# AutoHotkey Scripts

My collection of scripts for the Windows FOSS AutoHotkey utility, which I can highly recommend. You can find the utility along with detailed documentation here:

[AutoHotkey.com](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

You will need this installed on your Windows machine to use the scripts or create your own.
